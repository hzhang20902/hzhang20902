- 👋 Hi, I’m Henry Zhang
- 🎸I'm a Mississippi-born and raised, Philly-hardened industry [guitarist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6bBF_57KaY) with a decade of professional experience 
- 💾transitioning to the tech world!
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and building technologies that can benefit the community at large, 
- especially [independent music endeavors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xAy6lxBZLY).
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently an ensemble director and guitar instructor at Philadelphia's historic and only institution for jazz, 
- [the Clef Club](https://clefclubofjazz.org/). I am also learning all the nuances in the rabbitholes of fullstack development, such as:
- 
- [Threejs, GLTF, Blender, React Three Fiber/Drei](https://deploy-react-three-test.herokuapp.com/) (Takes a few to fully load, but click, drag, zoom!)
- ReactJs
- RESTful APIs, MVC(+Service), Java/Spring Boot
- PSQL, dB migration, and integration w/Maven and Flyway
- app deployment and web hosting
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that work to bring people together
- and empower them to create.
