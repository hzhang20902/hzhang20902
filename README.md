- 👋 Hi, I’m Henry Zhang
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and building technologies that can benefit the community at large, and specifically independent music endeavors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the nuances in the rabbitholes of fullstack development, such as:
- Threejs
- ReactJs
- RESTful APIs
- JavaSpring
- PSQL
- dB migration
- app deployment and web hosting
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that look to bring people together, and empower them to create.
